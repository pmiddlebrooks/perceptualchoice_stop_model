# Perceptual choice stop-signal task stochastic accumulator model
Codes to analyze population neural responses recorded during choice countermanding task.

## Folders:
### data
Contains folders of dates, each of which corresponds to a set of model fits.

### src
Contains both matlab functions and ipython (jupyter) notebooks with scripts to run sets of matlab functions to implement the various model instantiations. Dated folders in both "code" and "notebooks" folders correspond to the dated folders in the "data" folder.

#### src -> code
The matlab functions used to model the data.

#### src -> notebooks
Implement the notebooks in this order:
- Perceptual choice stop-signal task.ipynb
- Perceptual choice GO x0.ipynb
- Perceptual choice STOP x0 .ipynb
- Plot Model Fits.ipynb
