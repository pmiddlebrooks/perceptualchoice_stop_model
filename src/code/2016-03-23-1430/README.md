Scripts to fit GO trials for both subjects under a new model
========================

The new model is a test (and proof of concept). Instead of parsing the experimental factors as 2 stimuli, 2 responses, and 3 conditions, I will form a model of 1 stimulus, 2 responses, and 6 conditions. I believe these 2 models are equivalent and will result in equivalent fits. However, the new design will allow me to test a broader range of parameter variation across factors.
